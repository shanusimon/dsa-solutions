//  Insertion Sort

/**
 *  Description:
 * In insertion sort, we build the sorted array one element at a time by inserting
 * each element into its correct position relative to the elements before it.
 * Think of sorting playing cards in your hand.
 * 
 *  Time Complexity:
 *   - Best Case:    O(n)        // When the array is already sorted
 *   - Average Case: O(n^2)
 *   - Worst Case:   O(n^2)      // When the array is sorted in reverse
 * 
 *  Space Complexity:
 *   - O(1) â†’ In-place sorting
 * 
 *
